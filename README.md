# Digital Logic Design – Final Project  
### Aleyna Gener  

## 📌 Project Description
This project involves the design of a **15-pixel (5x3) LED display system** and an **ID code generator**.  
The system displays digits from a student number sequentially using binary inputs, logic gates, and a timing circuit.  
All circuits were simulated and tested on **TinkerCAD**.

## 🔹 Part 1 – 5x3 Pixel LED Display Adapter
- Created a **truth table** for numbers 0–9  
- Generated **K-maps** for each LED  
- Obtained **Boolean expressions** from K-maps  
- Implemented the circuit using **LogiSim** and **TinkerCAD**  
- Inputs A, B, C, D represent binary codes of the displayed digit  
- LEDs light up according to the Boolean expressions

## 🔹 Part 2 – ID Code Generator
- Designed a **state machine** using a state diagram  
- A **1 Hz clock** synchronizes the system  
- Generates a sequence that displays the digits:  
  `22202 → 42451`  
- Implemented using K-maps and logic circuits  
- Fully simulated in TinkerCAD
